# Bikesharing
•	Using tableau to analyze bikeshare data in NYC

## Overview of Analysis
•	The purpose of the challenge was to show that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The key factor we need to look at is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips are in the month of August will give us a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike.

### Results:
•	Using Tableau, I created 7 different visualizations using the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration. Here is what I found:

o	The busiest rental spots are in areas of high foot traffic.

#### Summary
•	In summary, Thursday is the most popular day for bike rentals. It would be a good idea for the investors to start the bikeshare business in Des Moines because whether people are biking to get to work or just doing it for fun there are lots of subscribers/ customers who will buy in. I believe we have enough evidence to convince our investors to do this even if we are only looking at one month of data. Some other visualizations that we can look at are the colder months in New York to see how many riders we have in November/December so that the investors can prepare for those months. One other visualization I would like to make is the average distance between customers home locations and the bike renting location which would allow the investors to adjust for potential biker locations.
